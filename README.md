Make transitmaxxing simpler

## Basic Features (WIP)

As a user, I want to:
- view a list of all bus routes
- view a list of all stops a bus stops at
- view the (static) timing of when the bus is at a given stop.
- pin a list of stop-bus pairs to my dashboard.
- see the (real) time next bus at my pinned stops.
